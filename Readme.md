## Simulation of Localization algorithm

### Instructions for creating Simulation Environment

1. Install Python 3.7.0 and pip 18.0 in your PC.
2. Clone the repository to directory of your PC.
3. Open terminal in directory where repository is cloned and enter command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

>_Users may also prefer to create a virtual environment to run simulator_

### Instructions to use simulator:

1. Run the main.py file
1. Terminal will ask for following inputs:
    1. Number of Soldiers
    1. Number of Enemies
    1. Number of frames to be analyzed.
1. After entering above inputs hit enter. Wait for terminal to display "Simulation complete"
1. In plots directory, open MapX.html in browser to view results. MapX denotes results for Xth frame. For example Map0.html shows localization results for 0th frame, Map1.html for 1st frame and so on. Open only those many maps as you have entered as input to number of frames to be analyzed.
